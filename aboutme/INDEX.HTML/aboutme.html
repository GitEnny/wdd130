        <p> Hi Everyone! My name is Eniola Emmanuel Ogundele. My hometown is Lagos, Nigeria. My major is Accounting with a cluster in Programming. 
            I enjoy listening to music, cooking, running, playing sports, and being outside. Recently, I enjoyed eating Cafe Rio - Quesadillas & Burrito or sushi and so many things. Just call me a foodie :) My talent would be singing. I love BYU-Idaho because of the unique & exceptional educational experience with a wholesome academic, cultural, and social environment. I am taking this course because a career in information technology can be lucrative, rewarding, and take me around the world. I hope to be able to learn more about Web Development at the end of this class.    </body>
