        <h2>[Eniola Ogundele</h2>
        <h2>[E-Man]</h2>
        <p>[Hometown- Lagos, Nigeria. My major is Accounting with a cluster in Programming. 
            I enjoy listening to music, cooking, running, playing sports, and being outside. Recently, I enjoyed eating Cafe Rio - Quesadillas & Burrito or sushi or so many things. Just call me a foodie :) My talent would be singing. I love BYU-Idaho because the exceptional educational experience is unique with a wholesome academic, cultural, and social environment. A career in information technology can be lucrative, rewarding, and take me around the world. I am taking this course because I am required to take it for my cluster.  I hope to be able to understand parts of the computer hardware and learn the fundamentals of programming that can set me apart from my counterparts in the technology-driven world. I will use this course information in my accounting career as programming is very vital in the accounting field.]
